# Code Refactor Challenge

For this challenge, I will be optimizing a webpage for further accessiblity and efficiency. This was accomplished by:

<li>Accessing the source code HTML, locating "div" elements and refactoring them into semantic elements like "main", article", "aside", etc.</li>

<li>Adding img attributes in the event that they are unable to load, and...

<li>consolidating unnecessarily duplicated CSS elements
